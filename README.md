# Project: ConversaFina
Chatbot aimed at financial education

# Description
   ConversaFina is a comprehensive service designed to provide personalized financial advice through an interactive chat. 
   The frontend offers a fluid and responsive user experience, while the backend ensures secure and efficient data 
   management. 
   
   The project integrates modern technologies such as React, TypeScript, Vite, Express, Firebase, JWT, MongoDB and Ollama 
   to offer a robust and scalable solution.

# Prototype
   To build this product, a prototype was developed using the Figma tool, creating a simulation scenario for detecting 
   profiles and also offering the user the option of asking the chatbot a question on the topic of financial education.
